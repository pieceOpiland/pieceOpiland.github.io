This is just my first post here. I'm playing around with Jekyll. It seems like a pretty cool
static template system. I'm hoping to get a bit more experience with new technologies. I've
done a lot of manual web development work, yet I've never experimented too much with
template engines like WordPress or Jekyll.

 With this project, I'd like to branch out a bit more, and be able to build my own theme, and
 see what other cool stuff I can accomplish with Jekyll. I'd also like to document new and cool
 things that I work on during my free time.
