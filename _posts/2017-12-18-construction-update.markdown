### Ok, I know, it's been a year, and the homepage still needs work...

But I've been really busy over this past year (not on this blog of course!). I feel
like I've begun to do a lot of other interesting new things! If you've paid attention
to my GitHub account at all, you'll notice that I've played around with two new
free platforms: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
I've had fun playing around with these two platforms, and I like the price of both, free!

Enough about that though, this is meant to be an update on how things are going with
this site, not what I've been working on (I'll leave that for another post). Hopefully,
you see the page for the individual posts has changed **significantly**. There's now the
option for a hero image (with a grey background fallback if left unspecified), and the
option for a subtitle. This was pretty simple to do, it was just a matter of focusing on
this project as opposed to the other projects that I've been chasing down.

Despite having finally set aside some time for this project, I still have a few more
things that I'd like to get around to:

- Redesigned homepage
- Parallax effect on posts

Jeez, that really isn't much...Haha! I should probably try to come up with some more cool
things that I want to include on this site. Hopefully they will come as I get more
features integrated into the theme. Now that I have hero images on posts, I am tempted
to pull those into the homepage to give the bland panels that are currently littered across
it a bit more life.

I know there isn't really much content to this, but hopefully once I get this going more
quickly, I'll be more motivated to build more content and more features into this theme.
