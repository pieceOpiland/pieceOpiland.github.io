Please excuse the mess...

Well, it's been a while since I've last been active on this blog. I previously said that I wanted to try and build a
custom jekyll theme, and that's exactly what I've been doing (among other things). Surprisingly, everything was really
straightforward using Jekyll as a static site generator. Essentially, all you do is make an HTML page and provide an
outlet for content. That's all there really is to the Jekyll part of making a new theme. The niceties of a theme come
the [liquid](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid) template system. As such, this experience has been much more of a
dive into liquid rather than sass or Jekyll as I had hoped.
